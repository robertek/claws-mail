		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org
		      
Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added a hidden option, 'show_inline_attachments'. When this is
  de-activated inline attachments referenced by other message parts,
  (e.g. attached images referenced in an HTML message part), are
  hidden. This is on by default, maintaining previous behaviour.

* Added a hidden option, 'msgview_date_format'. When this option is
  activated the Date format in the Message View will have the same
  format as in the Message List. The format of the date is also
  controlled in the same way, by the option on the Display/Summaries
  page of the Preferences. This is off by default, maintaining
  previous behaviour.
		
* Several GUI improvements:
	o Reworked Simplify Subject RegExp in the Folder Properties
	o The IMAP option 'Move deleted mails to trash and expunge
	  immediately' has been moved to the Advanced page of the
	  Account Preferences.

	  been moved to theSend page of the Account Preferences.
